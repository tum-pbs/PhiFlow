    Computes the differential advection term using the differentiation Scheme indicated by `order`, ´implicit´ and `upwind`.

    For a velocity field u, the advection term as it appears on the right-hand-side of a PDE is -u·∇u, including the negative sign.

    For unstructured meshes, computes -1/V ∑_f (n·u_prev) u ρ A

    Args:
        u: Scalar or vector-valued `Field` sampled on a `CenteredGrid`, `StaggeredGrid` or `Mesh`.
        velocity: `Field` that can be sampled at the elements of `u`.
            For FVM, the advection term is typically linearized by setting `velocity = previous_velocity`.
            Passing `velocity=u` yields non-linear terms which cannot be traced inside linear functions.
        order: Spatial order of accuracy.
            Higher orders entail larger stencils and more computation time but result in more accurate results assuming a large enough resolution.
            Supported for grids: 2 explicit, 4 explicit, 6 implicit (inherited from `phi.field.spatial_gradient()` and resampling).
            Passing order=4 currently uses 2nd-order resampling. This is work-in-progress.
            For FVM, the order is used when interpolating centroid values to faces if needed.
        implicit: When a `Solve` object is passed, performs an implicit operation with the specified solver and tolerances.
            Otherwise, an explicit stencil is used.
        upwind: Whether to use upwind interpolation. Only supported for FVM at the moment.

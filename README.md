Φ<sub>Flow</sub> is a research-oriented, open-source fluid simulation toolkit.
It is written mostly in Python and can use both NumPy and TensorFlow for execution.

Having all functionality of a fluid simulation running in TensorFlow opens up the possibility of back-propagating gradients through the simulation as well as running the simulation on GPUs.

## Features

- Variety of built-in fully-differentiable simulations, ranging from Burgers and Navier-Stokes to the Schrödinger equation.
- Tight integration with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (experimental) allowing for straightforward neural network training with fully differentiable simulations that [run on the GPU](documentation/GPU_Execution.md).
- Object-oriented architecture enabling concise and expressive code, designed for ease of use and extensibility.
- Reusable simulation code, independent of backend and dimensionality, i.e. the exact same code can run a 2D fluid sim using NumPy and a 3D fluid sim on the GPU using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Flexible, easy-to-use [web interface](documentation/Web_Interface.md) featuring live visualizations and interactive controls that can affect simulations or network training on the fly.

## Installation

To install Φ<sub>Flow</sub> with web interface, run:

```bash
$ pip install phiflow[gui]
```

Install TensorFlow or PyTorch in addition to Φ<sub>Flow</sub> to enable machine learning capabilities and GPU execution.

See the [detailed installation instructions](documentation/Installation_Instructions.md) on how to compile the custom CUDA operators and verify your installation.

If you would like to get right into it and have a look at some code, check out the
[tutorial notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S21OY8hzh1oZK2wQyL3BNXvSlrMTtRbV#offline=true&sandboxMode=true).
It lets you run fluid simulations with Φ<sub>Flow</sub> in the browser.

The following introductory demos are also helpful to get started with writing your own app using Φ<sub>Flow</sub>:

- [simpleplume.py](./demos/simpleplume.py): Runs a fluid simulation and displays it in the browser
- [optimize_pressure.py](./demos/optimize_pressure.py): Uses TensorFlow to optimize a velocity channel. TensorBoard can be started from the GUI and displays the loss.


### Running simulations

The [simulation overview](documentation/Simulation_Overview.md) explains how to run predefined simulations using either the [NumPy or TensorFlow](documentation/NumPy_and_TensorFlow_Execution.md) backend. It also introduces the GUI.

To learn how specific simulations are implemented, check out the documentation for [Fluids](documentation/Fluid_Simulation.md) or read about [staggered grids](documentation/Staggered_Grids.md) or [pressure solvers](documentation/Pressure_Solvers.md).

The [Φ<sub>Flow</sub> Web Interface](documentation/Web_Interface.md) guide introduces the high-level classes and explains how to launch and configure the built-in web interface for displaying simulations and interactive network training.

For I/O and data management, see the [data documentation](documentation/Reading_and_Writing_Data.md).


### Optimization and Learning

For training machine learning models, [this document](documentation/Interactive_Training_Apps.md) gives an introduction into writing a GUI-enabled application.


### Architecture

The [simulation code design documentation](documentation/Simulation_Architecture.md) provides a deeper look into the object-oriented code design of simulations.

All simulations of continuous systems are based on the [Field API](documentation/Fields.md) and underlying all states is the [struct API](documentation/Structs.ipynb).

The [software architecture documentation](documentation/Software_Architecture.md) shows the building blocks of Φ<sub>Flow</sub> and the module dependencies.

## Version History

The [Version history](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow/releases) lists all major changes since release.

## Known Issues

TensorBoard: Live supervision does not work when running a local app that writes to a remote directory.

Resampling / Advection: NumPy interpolation handles the boundaries slightly differently than TensorFlow.

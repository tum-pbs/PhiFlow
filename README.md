Φ<sub>Flow</sub> is an open-source simulation toolkit built for optimization and machine learning applications.
It is written mostly in Python and can be used with
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/),
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[Jax](https://github.com/google/jax)
or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
The close integration with these machine learning frameworks allows it to leverage their automatic differentiation functionality,
making it easy to build end-to-end differentiable functions involving both learning models and physics simulations.

This is major version 2 of Φ<sub>Flow</sub>.
Version 1 is available in the [branch `1.5`](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow/tree/1.5) but will not receive new features anymore.
Older versions are available through the [release history](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow/releases).

## Features

* Variety of built-in PDE operations with focus on fluid phenomena, allowing for concise formulation of simulations.
* Tight integration with PyTorch, Jax and TensorFlow for straightforward neural network training with fully differentiable simulations that can [run on the GPU](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/GPU_Execution.html#enabling-gpu-execution).
* Flexible, easy-to-use [web interface](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Web_Interface.html) featuring live visualizations and interactive controls that can affect simulations or network training on the fly.
* Object-oriented, vectorized design for expressive code, ease of use, flexibility and extensibility.
* Reusable simulation code, independent of backend and dimensionality, i.e. the exact same code can run a 2D fluid sim using NumPy and a 3D fluid sim on the GPU using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
* High-level linear equation solver with automated sparse matrix generation.

## Installation

Installation with pip on Python 3.6 or newer:
``` bash
$ pip install phiflow==2.0.0rc2 dash plotly imageio
```
Install TensorFlow or PyTorch in addition to Φ<sub>Flow</sub> to enable machine learning capabilities and GPU execution.
See the [detailed installation instructions](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/Installation_Instructions.html) on how to compile the custom CUDA operators and verify your installation.

An overview of all available documentation can be found [here](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/).

If you would like to get right into it and have a look at some code, check out the
[tutorial notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tum-pbs/PhiFlow/blob/develop/docs/Fluids_Tutorial.ipynb).
It lets you run fluid simulations with Φ<sub>Flow</sub> in the browser.

The following introductory demos are also helpful to get started with writing your own scripts using Φ<sub>Flow</sub>:

* [smoke_plume.py](demos/smoke_plume.py) runs a smoke simulation and displays it in the web interface.
* [optimize_pressure.py](demos/differentiate_pressure.py) uses TensorFlow to optimize a velocity field and displays it in the web interface.

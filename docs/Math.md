# Math

The [`phi.math` module](phi/math) provides abstract access to tensor operations.
It internally uses NumPy/SciPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch to execute the actual operations, depending on which backend is selected (see below).
This ensures that code written against `phi.math` functions produces equal results on all backends.

To that end, `phi.math` provides a new `Tensor` class which should be used instead of directly accessing native tensors from NumPy, TensorFlow or PyTorch. 
While similar to the native tensor classes, `phi.math.Tensor`s have named and typed dimensions.

When performing operations such as `+, -, *, /, %, **` or calling `math` functions on `Tensor`s, dimensions are matched by name and type.
This eliminates the need for manual reshaping or the use of singleton dimensions.

Example:
```python
from phi import math

math.ones(x=10) + math.ones(x=10)
# Out: (x=10) float32  2.0 < ... < 2.0

math.ones(x=5) + math.ones(batch=10)
# Out: (batch=10, x=5) float32  2.0 < ... < 2.0
```


## Shapes

The shape of a `Tensor` is represented by a [`Shape`](phi/math/#phi.math.Shape) object which can be accessed as `tensor.shape`.
In addition to the dimension sizes, the shape also stores the dimension names which determine their types.

There are four types of dimensions

| Dimension type |              Naming rules |                                                    Description | Example               |
|----------------|--------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------|
| Spatial        |             Single letter |                   Spans a grid with equidistant sample points. | `x`, `y`, `z`         |
| Channel        | `vector` or ends with `_` |    Set of properties sampled at per sample point per instance. | `vector`, `color_`    |
| Collection     |     Plural, ends with `s` | Collection of (interacting) objects belonging to one instance. | `points`, `particles` |
| Batch          |         None of the above |                               Lists non-interacting instances. | `batch`, `sequence`, `time`       |

The default dimension order is `(batch, collection, channel, spatial)`.
When a dimension is not present on a tensor, values are assumed to be constant along that dimension.
Based on these rules rule, operators and functions may add dimensions to tensors as needed. 

Many math functions handle dimensions differently depending on their type, or only work with certain types of dimensions.

Batch dimensions are ignored by all operations.
The result is equal to calling the function on each slice.

Spatial operations, such as `spatial_gradient()` or `divergence()` operate on spatial dimensions by default, ignoring all others.
When operating on multiple spatial tensors, these tensors are typically required to have the same spatial dimensions, else an `IncompatibleShapes` error may be raised.
The function `join_spaces()` can be used to add the missing spatial dimensions so that these errors are avoided.

| Operation                                               |    Batch    |  Collection |   Spatial   |    Channel    |
|---------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| convolve                                                |      -      |      -      |      â˜…      |       âŸ·       |
| nonzero                                                 |      -      |     â˜…/âŸ·     |     â˜…/âŸ·     |       âŸ·       |
| scatter (grid)<br>scatter (indices)<br>scatter (values) | -<br>-<br>- | ðŸ—™<br>âŸ·<br>âŸ· | â˜…<br>ðŸ—™<br>ðŸ—™ | -<br>âŸ·/ðŸ—™<br>- |
| gather/sample (grid)<br>gather/sample (indices)         |    -<br>-   |    ðŸ—™<br>-   |   â˜…/âŸ·<br>-  |    -<br>âŸ·/ðŸ—™   |

In the above table, `-` denotes batch-type dimensions, ðŸ—™ are not allowed, âŸ· are reduced in the operation, â˜… are active 

The preferred way to define a `Shape` is via the `shape()` function.
It takes the dimension sizes as keyword arguments.

```python
math.shape(batch=10, y=2, x=4, vector=2)
# Out: (batch=10, y=2, x=4, vector=2)
```

The dimension types are inferred from the names according to the following rules:

* Single letter &rarr; Spatial dimension
* Starts with 'vector' &rarr; Channel dimension
* Else &rarr; Batch dimension

```python
math.shape(batch=10, y=2, x=4, vector=2).types
# Out: ('batch', 'spatial', 'spatial', 'channel')
```

`Shape` objects should be considered *immutable*.
Do not change any property of a `Shape` directly.

Important `Shape` properties (see the [API documentation](phi/math/#phi.math.Shape) for a full list):

* `.sizes: tuple` enumerates the sizes as ints or None, similar to NumPy's shapes
* `.names: tuple` enumerates the dimension names
* `.rank: int = len(shape)` number of dimensions
* `.named_sizes` to iterate over `name, size` of each dimension
* `.batch: Shape` / `.spatial: Shape` / `.channel: Shape` contains only batch / spatial / channel dimensions
* `.non_batch: Shape` / `.non_spatial: Shape` / `.non_channel: Shape` contains only the other two types of dimensions
* `.batch_rank: Shape` / `.spatial_rank: Shape` / `.channel_rank: Shape` alias for `.batch.rank`
* `.volume` number of elements a tensor of this shape contains

Important `Shape` methods:

* `get_size(name)` returns the size of a dimension
* `index(name)` returns the position of a dimension
* `&` (`combined(Shape)`) returns a shape containing the dimensions from both shapes
* `expand_<type>(size, name, pos)` adds a dimension to the shape
* `extend(Shape)` adds all dimensions from the other shape to this one
* `without(dims)` drops the specified dimensions
* `only(dims)`, `select(*names)` drops all other dimensions

Additional tips and tricks

* `tuple(shape)` is equal to `shape.sizes`.
* `'x' in shape` tests whether a dimension by the name of 'x' is present.
* `shape1 == shape2` tests equality including names, types and order of dimensions.
* `shape1 + shape2` adds the sizes of the shapes.
* `shape1 & shape2` combines the shapes.
* `shape.x` returns the size of the dimension 'x'.
* `spatial_shape(Shape)` can be used to get the spatial part or create a new `Shape` depending on the input.


## Tensor Creation

The [`tensor()` function](phi/math/#phi.math.tensor)
converts a scalar, a `list`, a `tuple`, a NumPy array or a TensorFlow/PyTorch tensor to a `Tensor`.
The dimension names can be specified using the `names` keyword and dimension types are inferred from the names.
Otherwise, they are determined automatically.

```python
math.tensor([1, 2, 3])
# Out: (1, 2, 3) along vector

math.tensor(numpy.zeros([1, 5, 1, 2]), names='batch, x,y, vector')
# Out: (batch=1, x=5, y=1, vector=2) float64  0.0 < ... < 0.0

math.tensor(numpy.zeros([3, 3, 1]), names=['y', 'x', 'time'])
# Out: (y=3, x=3, time=1) float64  0.0 < ... < 0.0
```

There are a couple of functions in the `phi.math` module for creating basic tensors.

* [`zeros()`](phi/math/#phi.math.zeros)
* [`ones()`](phi/math/#phi.math.ones)
* [`linspace()`](phi/math/#phi.math.linspace)
* [`random_normal()`](phi/math/#phi.math.random_normal)
* [`random_uniform()`](phi/math/#phi.math.random_uniform)
* [`meshgrid()`](phi/math/#phi.math.meshgrid)

Most functions allow the shape of the tensor to be specified via a `Shape` object or alternatively through the keyword arguments.
In the latter case, the dimension types are inferred from the names.
```python
math.zeros(x=5, y=4)  # Tensor with two spatial dimensions
# Out: (x=5, y=4) float32  0.0 < ... < 0.0

math.zeros(math.shape(y=4, x=5))
# Out: (y=4, x=5) float32  0.0 < ... < 0.0

math.meshgrid(x=5, y=(0, 1, 2))
# Out: (x=5, y=3, vector=2) int64  0 < ... < 4
```


## Backend Selection

The `phi.math` library does not implement basic operators directly but rather delegates the calls to another computing library.
Currently, it supports three such libraries: NumPy/SciPy, TensorFlow and PyTorch.
These are referred to as *backends*.

The easiest way to use a certain backend is via the import statement:

* [`phi.flow`](phi/flow.html) &rarr; NumPy/SciPy
* [`phi.tf.flow`](phi/tf/flow.html) &rarr; TensorFlow
* [`phi.torch.flow`](phi/torch/flow.html) &rarr; PyTorch
* [`phi.jax.flow`](phi/torch/flow.html) &rarr; Jax

This determines what backend is used to create new tensors.
Existing tensors created with a different backend will keep using that backend.
For example, even if TensorFlow is set as the default backend, NumPy-backed tensors will continue using NumPy functions.

The global backend can be set directly using `math.backend.set_global_default_backend()`.
Backends also support context scopes, i.e. tensors created within a `with backend:` block will use that backend to back the new tensors.
The three backends can be referenced via the global variables `phi.math.NUMPY_BACKEND`, `phi.tf.TF_BACKEND` and `phi.torch.TORCH_BACKEND`.

When passing tensors of different backends to one function, an automatic conversion will be performed,
e.g. NumPy arrays will be converted to TensorFlow or PyTorch tensors.



## Indexing, Slicing, Unstacking

Indexing is read-only.
The recommended way of indexing or slicing tensors is using the syntax
```python
tensor.<dim>[start:end:step]
```
where `start >= 0`, `end` and `step > 0` are integers.
The access `tensor.<dim>` returns a temporary [`TensorDim`](https://tum-pbs.github.io/PhiFlow/phi/math/#phi.math.TensorDim)
object which can be used for slicing and unstacking along a specific dimension.
This syntax can be chained to index or slice multiple dimensions.
```python
tensor.x[:2].y[1:-1]
```

Alternatively tensors can be indexed using a dictionary of the form `tensor[{'dim': slice or int}]`.

Do not use negative values for `step`. Instead use `Tensor.flip(dim)` or `Tensor.<dim>.flip()`.


Tensors can be unstacked along any dimension using `t.unstack(dim)` or `t.<dim>.unstack()`.
When passing the dimension size to the latter, tensors can even be unstacked along dimensions they do not posess.

```python
math.zeros(x=4).x.unstack()
# Out: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

math.zeros(x=4).y.unstack(2)
# Out: ((0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) along x, (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) along x)

math.zeros(x=4).x.unstack(2)
# Out: AssertionError: Size of dimension x does not match 2.
```

## Non-uniform Tensors

The `math` package allows tensors of varying sizes to be stacked into a single tensor.
This tensor then has dimension sizes of type `Tensor` where the source tensors vary in size.

One use case of this are `StaggeredGrid`s where the tensors holding the vector components have different shapes.
```python
math.channel_stack([math.zeros(a=4, b=2), math.zeros(b=2, a=5)], 'c')
# Out: (a=(4, 5) along c, b=2, c=2) float32  0.0 < ... < 0.0
```

Non-uniform tensors have the property that their second-order shape has more than one dimension.
```python
math.channel_stack([math.zeros(a=4, b=2), math.zeros(b=2, a=5)], 'c').shape.shape
# Out: (dims=3, c=2)
```



## Data Types and Precision

The package `phi.math` provides a custom [`DataType` class](phi/math/#phi.math.DType) that can be used with all backends.
There are no global variables for common data types; instead you can create one by specifying the kind and length in bits.
```python
float32 = math.DType(float, 32)
int64 = math.DType(int, 64)
complex128 = math.DType(complex, 128)
bool_ = math.DType(bool)

float32
# Out: float32

float32.kind
# Out: <class 'float'>

int64.itemsize
# Out: 8

complex128.bits
# Out: 128

complex128.precision
# Out: 64
```

By default, floating point operations use 32 bit (single precision).
This can be changed globally using
[`math.set_global_precision(64)`](phi/math/#phi.math.set_global_precision)
or locally using [`with math.precision(64):`](phi/math/#phi.math.precision).

This setting does not affect integers.
To specify the number of integer bits, use [`math.to_int()`](phi/math/#phi.math.to_int)
or cast the data type directly using [`math.cast()`](phi/math/#phi.math.cast).
